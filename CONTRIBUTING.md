We are happy to see contributions. You can add utility code that you see is missing, improve existing one, or open issue tickets. 
Before you open PR:
- write unit tests for your code
- run `make gcovr-report`, open `gcovr-report/coverage.html`, and make sure you made 100% code coverage for changes
- run `make format`
- run `make cppcheck`
- run `make misra`

After PR is opened, we will review your code, and after that code can be merged into the main branch.
